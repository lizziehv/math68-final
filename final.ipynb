    "## Introduction\n",
    "In representation theory, matrices are a way to model an abstract group that can help us understand the group in detail. More specifically, we have the following definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1.** A *matrix representation* of a group $G$ is a homomorphism $X: G \\to GL_d$ where $GL_d$ is the general linear group of degree $d$ made of invertible $d\\times d$ matrices. That is,\n",
    "1. $X(\\epsilon) = I$, where $\\epsilon$ is the unity of $G$\n",
    "2. $X(gh) = X(g)X(h)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some representations are built out of smaller ones, while others are indivisible. The latter kind are known as *irreducible representations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A representation requires keeping track of a lot of information, but it turns out that one can obtain most of a representation's useful information by looking at one simple statistic: the associated *character* of the representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.** Let $X$ be a representation of $G$. Then, the *character* of $X$ for all $g\\in G$ is \n",
    "$$\\chi(g) = tr X(g),$$\n",
    "where $tr X(g)$ is the trace of the matrix $X(g)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ is an irreducible representation, then $\\chi(g)$ is an irreducible character.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposition 1.** Recall that $a, b\\in G$ are conjugates if there exists $g\\in G$ such that $b = g^{-1}ag$ and the equivalence classes of this equivalence relation are called conjugacy classes. If $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$, then for all $a, b \\in K$, $\\chi(b) = \\chi(a)$. Thus, we define $\\chi_K = \\chi(g)$ for any $g\\in K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Proof.* By definition, there exists some $g$ such that $b = g^{-1}ag$, so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tr X(b) = tr X(g^{-1}ag) = tr X(g^{-1}) X(a) X(g) = tr X(g)^{-1} X(a) X(g) = tr X(a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since trace is invariant under conjugation. $\\blacksquare$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.** A *character table* is an array with columns indexed by the conjugacy classes of $G$ and rows indexed by the irreducible characters of $G$. Thus, for a conjugacy class $K$ and an irreducible character $\\chi^{(i)}$, entry $(\\chi^{(i)}, K)$ is $\\chi^{(i)}_K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ c|ccc } \n",
    "  & \\cdots & K & \\cdots \\\\ \n",
    "  \\hline\n",

    " \\chi^{(i)} & \\cdots & \\chi^{(i)}_K & \\\\\n",
    " \\vdots & & & \n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear at all that there should be a finite number of irreducible representations $\\chi^{(i)}$ should be finite. It turns out, however, that the number of irreducible representations (and characters) of $G$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of $G$. That is, the character table is always a square. \n",
    "\n",
    "The irreducible representations of $S_n$, and other groups, are not known in general for arbitrary $n$. In this context, the word \"modules\" is more applicable than \"representations\". It is known, however, that the irreducible characters of $S_n$ are indexed by a Yound diagram of size $n$, which is a partition of $n$. Thus, the character indices are $\\chi^{\\lambda}$ for all tableaux $\\lambda$ of $n$ elements. "

    "## The Main Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation 1.** Recall that $\\pi_1, \\pi_2 \\in S_n$, the symmetric group, belong to the same conjugacy class if and only if $\\pi_1, \\pi_2$ have the same cycle type. Thus, a character can be indexed by its cycle type, which is a partition of $n$.\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- is connected\n",
    "\n",
    "The *height of a ribbon*, $ht(r)$ is the number of rows in $\\lambda / \\mu$ minus 1. We will soon see examples of this definition when we implement the function `reduce` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem.** The Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule is an algorithm to compute the irreducible characters of the symmetric group $S_n$. Since the character of a permutation is indexed by a partition and the character is the same for permutations with the same cycle type, we compute $\\chi_{\\mu}^{\\lambda}$ for a cycle type $\\mu = (\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_{\\ell})$ and a tableau $\\lambda$ as follows\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the information contained in a representation is encoded by the representation's character. For example, two representations are equivalent if and only if they have the same character. This is why computing the characters of a group is of interest in the field of representation theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, computing character tables is not an easy task. For $S_n$, however, the Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule provides a way of easily and somewhat efficiently computing these tables.\n",
